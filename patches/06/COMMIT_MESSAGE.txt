feat: Add macOS Threat Detection & Response Framework (MTDRF)

Implement comprehensive Python3 security framework for detection, prevention,
mitigation, and forensic analysis of macOS stealer malware and ad-hoc signed
threats. Designed for security researchers and incident response teams.

## Features

- Modular architecture with independent modules for focused analysis
- Multiple detection methods: binary analysis, process monitoring, file access
  monitoring, Keychain monitoring, network monitoring
- Prevention capabilities: file protection, network firewall rules, Keychain
  protection
- Mitigation tools: quarantine, cleanup, and recovery procedures
- Forensic analysis: deep binary analysis, process tree analysis, log analysis
- Dual mode operation: user-level and admin-level with graceful degradation
- Multiple output formats: CLI with custom color palette and JSON output

## Project Structure

- Main CLI orchestrator (mtdrf.py) with commands: detect, prevent, mitigate,
  forensic, scan, monitor, report
- Detectors: binary_analyzer, process_monitor, file_monitor, keychain_monitor,
  network_monitor
- Preventers: file_protection, network_firewall, keychain_protection
- Mitigators: quarantine, cleanup, recovery
- Forensic tools: binary_forensics, process_analyzer, log_analyzer
- Utilities: colors (custom palette), output (CLI/JSON), permissions, system_info
- Configuration management with customizable detection thresholds

## Technical Details

- Uses native macOS tools (codesign, strings, log, fsevents, etc.)
- Custom color palette for CLI output (#FFFFB8, #FFFF99, #DEDDFA, #A6A4D7, etc.)
- Rich library for true-color terminal support with fallback to colorama
- Click framework for CLI interface
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Read-only operations by default with explicit confirmation for destructive ops
- Quarantine before deletion with audit trail

## Threat Model

Detects:
1. Ad-hoc signed binaries (adhoc, linker-signed, no TeamIdentifier)
2. Credential stealing attempts (Chrome, Exodus, etc.)
3. Cryptocurrency wallet theft
4. System profiling for hardware identifiers
5. Keychain exfiltration (Chrome Safe Storage)
6. Network exfiltration patterns (localhost:8000)
7. Process behavior anomalies
